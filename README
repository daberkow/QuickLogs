Version 3.1 adds a core file that has all the disconnect and reconnect stuff for mysql, this way I am not having to change login info in 4+ places
Also you can add options under settings now
The database moved fro ma bad date stamp to standard linux time stamp, so the lite folder has a script to migrate database, if for some reason this is being used, BACKUP DATABASE FIRST
Charts fixed
Version now has a source link
